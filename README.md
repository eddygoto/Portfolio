# Portfolio

## Homework 2

My goal this week was to build a professional portfolio from scratch using my newfound html and css skills.
Unfortunately, it didn't turn out very well. I ran into a lot of difficulties especially with display:flex and figuring out how to ideally format the website. I turn this assignment in knowing that I have a lot of code to improve and a lot more to learn about css.
I am grateful for this assignment because I realize how difficult creating code from scratch is because although I feel capable whilst we review and do exercises in class, I'm clearly not ready to do the task solo yet. It's something to improve on.

## Installion

The environment should be up and running on my Github: https://eddygoto.github.io/Portfolio/

## Usage

The website will be used for me to showcase my progress as I continue my full stack developer journey.
